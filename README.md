# How to Git

Before my first industry job, I was only using three very basic commands in git `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`. It is great and it gets the job done but the Git World is way more exciting and there are way more commands in Git that I was not aware of before. So here, I put together some of the Git topics that I have encountered.
