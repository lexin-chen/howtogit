# `git pull` vs `git pull —rebased` vs `git rebased`

### `git pull`

`git pull` is a command that fetches changes from a remote repository and then merges those changes into your current branch. It’s essentially a combination of `git fetch` followed by `git merge`.

For example:

- If you're on a branch named `feature-branch` and you run `git pull`, Git will fetch updates from the remote branch that `feature-branch` tracks and then merge those changes into your local `feature-branch`.
- This merge might result in a **merge commit** if there are new commits in both branches, which can sometimes clutter the history with extra commits.

### `git pull --rebase`

`git pull --rebase` also fetches changes from the remote repository, but instead of merging them, it rebases your local commits on top of the fetched changes. This effectively re-applies your local commits on top of the remote branch, which helps maintain a cleaner, linear commit history. 

For example:

- If you have commits `A`, `B`, and `C` on your local branch, and commits `D` and `E` on the remote branch, running `git pull --rebase` will fetch `D` and `E`, then reapply your local commits `A`, `B`, and `C` on top of them. Your history will appear as if `A`, `B`, and `C` were made after `D` and `E` without a merge commit.

### `git rebase`

`git rebase` is a standalone command that allows you to reapply commits from one branch onto another. It’s often used to clean up commit history before merging changes into a main branch or to incorporate updates from another branch.

For example:

- If you have a branch `feature-branch` and you want to rebase it onto `main`, you would switch to `feature-branch` and run `git rebase main`. This will take the commits from `feature-branch`, reapply them on top of `main`, and rewrite the history of `feature-branch`.

Use `git rebase` for more fine-grained control over commit history, especially when integrating changes from different branches.

# Summary

- **Merge vs. Rebase:**
    - `git pull` merges changes, which can create a merge commit and make the history less linear.
    - `git pull --rebase` rebases changes, maintaining a linear commit history.
- **Context:**
    - `git pull` and `git pull --rebase` are commands used to update your local branch with changes from the remote branch. The former does so with a merge, while the latter does so with a rebase.
    - `git rebase` is used independently to reapply commits from one branch onto another, not necessarily tied to a pull operation.
