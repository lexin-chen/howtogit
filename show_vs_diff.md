# `git show` vs `git diff --staged`

The `git diff` and `git show` commands in Git serve different purposes when inspecting changes. Here's a comparison of the specific commands you mentioned:

### `git diff --staged origin/master`

- **Purpose**: Shows the differences between the staged changes and the `origin/master` branch.
- **Usage**: This command is typically used to review changes that have been staged for the next commit relative to what’s in the `origin/master` branch.
- **Output**: Displays the differences between what is currently staged (i.e., changes added to the index) and the latest commit on the `origin/master` branch. It highlights what will be included in the next commit if you were to run `git commit` now.

**Example:**

```bash
git diff --staged origin/master
```

### `git show`

- **Purpose**: Displays information about a specific commit, including the commit message, author, date, and the changes introduced by that commit.
- **Usage**: This command is used to inspect a commit’s details. You can provide a commit hash or reference to see the details of a particular commit.
- **Output**: Includes the commit metadata (such as the author, date, and commit message) and a diff of the changes introduced by that commit.

**Example:**

```bash

git show <commit-hash>
```

### Key Differences

1. **Scope**:
    - `git diff --staged origin/master`: Compares staged changes against a branch.
    - `git show`: Displays details of a specific commit.
2. **Usage Context**:
    - Use `git diff --staged` when you want to see what changes are staged and how they compare to another branch or commit.
    - Use `git show` when you want to inspect a particular commit in detail, including its changes.
3. **Output Details**:
    - `git diff --staged` only shows the diff of the changes that are staged.
    - `git show` provides a complete view of the commit including the diff of changes, commit metadata, and possibly the commit message.

### Summary

- If you want to review what you have staged for the next commit in relation to `origin/master`, use `git diff --staged origin/master`.
- If you want to see the details of a specific commit, including its changes and metadata, use `git show <commit-hash>`.
